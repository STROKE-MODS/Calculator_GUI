## 🧮 PyQt5 Calculator

### 📘 Overview

This is a **GUI-based Calculator** built using **Python and PyQt5**.
It supports real-time calculations using both **button clicks** and **keyboard input**, with smooth decimal handling and operator logic.

The project was built entirely from scratch — handling frontend layout, event management, and backend arithmetic logic manually.

---

### ⚡ Features

✅ Basic arithmetic operations — `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
✅ Keyboard support for digits and operators
✅ Decimal point input support
✅ “AC” button to clear current values
✅ Real-time display updates
✅ Responsive PyQt5 GUI layout

---

### 🧠 How It Works

* **Frontend (GUI):**
  Created using `QGridLayout` with PyQt5 widgets (`QPushButton`, `QLabel`, etc.).

* **Backend Logic:**
  Handles number input, operator selection, and performs arithmetic operations dynamically.

* **Keyboard Support:**
  Implemented via `keyPressEvent` to map keyboard keys directly to calculator functions.
